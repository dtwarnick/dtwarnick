Hi. Iâ€™m Derek. I don't have a lot of stuff up here on github yet, but I'll get to it..... eventually! 

ðŸ’» I work at [3M](https://www.3m.com/) as a senior software engineer. I've been there for a long time and I mostly enjoy it (you know how it goes). At work, I code in C# and JavaScript with some legacy code maintained in C/C++. I would love to dive deeper into Python, databases, and ML/AI. I'll get to it..... eventually!

When I'm not working, I enjoy being outdoors (ðŸ¥¾hiking, ðŸ§—climbing, ðŸŽ¿skiing, ðŸŒ„backpacking, ðŸš²biking, all the usual stuff). Anyway, you can find out more about me here [derekwarnick.com](http://derekwarnick.com). I don't have a lot of stuff there yet, but I'll get to it..... eventually! :)
